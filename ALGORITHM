This placeholder is for the algorithm.

Am looking for someone to describe an algorithm, in English, that can be implemented.

There has been prior discussion on Bridgewinners.


I'll start...

For a given event, the entire state of the event will be passed in.


1. Build a graph that contains a list of all teams and who they have played.

2. Find the list of teams available for the current round (the current round is the round that we are trying to find matches for).

3. If list of teams is 0, return ??

4. Sort the list of available teams.

5. Attempt to match team 1 and team 2. If they have already played, continue to find a team that team 1 has not played.

6. Need to include some logic about making sure that given a match, there is still a possible solution.



Clearly the above isn't finished. I just wanted to show the level of documentation that will be needed for the algorithm.

Need to identify special cases, e.g. 3 teams to play in a 2 round, round-robin format.
