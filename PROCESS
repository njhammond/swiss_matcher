This documents the process by which the work will be done.

1. Get agreement on the REQUIREMENTS and other documents.

2. Someone starts working on the ALGORITHM. Writes it up in plain English.

3. Development starts with the main code and testing. Development can start during Phase 2 as debug and infrastructure code can be written. For example, someone can spec out the format of a test file and write code to read the test file.

4. Code gets to a point where it needs integration testing.

We can decide how to proceed from there. 

We need to define who gets to make any final decisions; for now, Nicolas will assume that role but ideally looking for a long term maintainer of this code. Will depend on how much work each person does.


Anyone interested in working on the project should send Nicolas an email, either through GitHub or externally. Nicolas will then add you as a colloborator.
