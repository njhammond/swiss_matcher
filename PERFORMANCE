Performance may become an issue. This gem is stateless, i.e. it maintains no 
information about any previous calls. This gem may degrade towards the end of an event with a large number of teams. There may be ways to pass 'state', i.e., the 'map' back to the calling program.

This issue is deferred to version 2 of the software, or least later.
