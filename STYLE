There are various Ruby style guides out there.

Not going to pick a specific one.

Nicolas prefers

if (a == 1) then
  do this
end

The then is not needed, but makes the code more readable to a non-Ruby person.
The brackets are also not needed, but again, more readable.
Old fashioned K&R style for spacing.
Prefer a tab stop of 2.

Ideally no lines > 80 char.

Leave the IDE up to you.

Personally I still use vi, so going with least common denominator.

Main reason for wanting to use 'old' style is readability and ease of translation to other languages.
